# Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-MobileNet

Real time detection using MobileNet ssd model. It can detect "background", "aeroplane", "bicycle", "bird", "boat","bottle", "bus", "car", "cat", "chair", "cow", "diningtable","dog", "horse", "motorbike", "person", "pottedplant", "sheep","sofa", "train", "tvmonitor". 

If you want to detect only particular objects from these data then just change at line 86 in file. 

I have tested this in windows as well as in linux (Eg. Raspberry Pi)
